My project idea
Hi! I decide to make a pokedex of pokemom, it is somenthing i wanted to do before because i was very interested
in doing a pokedex. The pokedex will show all the pokemons of the first generation and will have a filter 
of type it also will have the option of search from a name to make it easier. 
the project will make use of elements like fetch to retrieve data from the PokeAPI and .then() method,
i also will use object to represent the data of the pokeapi like ID, Height and weight, i will use array
functions like .map() , .some() ,join() to manipulate and process data as well.
